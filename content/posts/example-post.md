# Getting Started with Next.js 14 and App Router

Next.js 14 introduces the revolutionary App Router, a new way to build React applications that provides better performance, improved developer experience, and more intuitive routing.

## What's New in Next.js 14

The App Router represents a fundamental shift in how Next.js applications are structured. Instead of the traditional `pages` directory, we now use an `app` directory with a more file-system-based routing approach.

### Key Features

- **Server Components**: Run React components on the server for better performance
- **Streaming**: Progressive page loading with Suspense
- **Layouts**: Shared UI that preserves state across route changes
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading UI for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Granular error boundaries for better debugging

## Setting Up Your First App Router Project

To get started with Next.js 14 and the App Router, create a new project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with the App Router enabled by default.

## Understanding the App Directory Structure

The new `app` directory follows a specific structure:

```
app/
├── layout.js          # Root layout
├── page.js           # Home page
├── loading.js        # Loading UI
├── error.js          # Error UI
├── not-found.js      # 404 page
└── blog/
    ├── page.js       # Blog listing
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.js   # Dynamic blog post
```

## Creating Your First Layout

Layouts in the App Router allow you to share UI across multiple pages:

```javascript
// app/layout.js
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <header>
          <h1>My App</h1>
        </header>
        <main>{children}</main>
        <footer>
          <p>&copy; 2024 My App</p>
        </footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Server vs Client Components

One of the most important concepts in the App Router is the distinction between Server and Client Components:

- **Server Components**: Run on the server, can access databases directly
- **Client Components**: Run in the browser, can use React hooks and browser APIs

To create a Client Component, add the `'use client'` directive:

```javascript
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

The App Router in Next.js 14 represents the future of React development. With its focus on performance, developer experience, and modern web standards, it's an excellent choice for building scalable web applications.
